<li markdown="1" class="page-break-before">Consider this code:

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class Problem {

    private String thing;
    private int num;

    public Problem (String thing, int num) {
	this.thing = thing;
	this.num = num;
    }
    
    public static void main (String [] args) {
	Problem p = new Problem("Potato",42);
	System.out.println(p);
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

Suppose this program is compiled and executed.  Consider the moment in time when the line `System.out.println(p);` is executed.

<ol>
<li> (10 pts) At that moment, which is true of the variable `p`?
