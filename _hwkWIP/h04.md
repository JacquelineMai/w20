*Reading Assignment:* 

* Read <span data-hfj="7"></span> and <span data-hfj="8"></span>, along with the online reading notes that go with those chapters. 

Also skim JN7 Ch2 pp. 33-50.  While you should read the HFJ chapters carefully, in this case, pp. 33-50 can mostly be skimmed; they are primarily for reference and I want you to know where to turn in the book if you need that material.   You should, however, make sure you understand the difference between associativy and precedence, and read carefully enough that you are able find the answers to the questions given.

Then, do the problems below.   Refer back to previous chapters as needed.

<li>
(10 pts)  Based on your reading in <span data-hfj="7" ></span>, complete the following exercise from p. 179, putting a check next to the relationships that make sense.

(10 pts)  Based on your reading in <span data-hfj="7" />:

What does it mean to have a "polymorphic argument" or a "polymorphic
return type" for a method?  Explain with an example&mdash;but NOT
using the example of Vets and Animals used in the book.  Substitute
your own example.  Give a detailed enough description of the class
hierarchy you have in mind to make it clear that you get the concept.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">Java code examples</h3>

Several questions on this page ask you to illustrate your answers with Java code excerpts.

Your examples do not need to be a "complete" Java classes.  They can be partial Java classes
with with some ellipsis (...) to show parts you are leaving out.  It needs to
   have just enough detail to illustrate the point you are making. For example the following
   Java code might be used to illustrate various things (what those are is left for you to
   figure out.)

```java
public class Bar { ... }
public class Baz { ... }
public class Foo extends Bar {
  private Baz thingy;
  ...
}
```

(10 pts) What is one advantage of using an `ArrayList` over a plain old Java array (e.g.&nbsp;`ArrayList<Integer> nums;` vs. `int [] nums;`)?

Two terms that are very important, and commonly confused are *overloading* vs. *overriding*. 
There is a passage in <span data-hfj="7"></span> that helps to explain the difference.

<ol>
 <li style="margin-bottom: 10em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Explain what overloading is, with a *specific* example
 of Java code.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (5 pts) How many levels of operator precedence are there in Java?
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:3em;"> (5 pts) In Java (also in C and C++) there is an operator with three operands (a "ternary" operator). The first operand must always be an expression of a specific type.  What is this type?
