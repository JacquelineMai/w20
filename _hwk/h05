*Reading Assignment:* We are skipping ahead to Chapter 7 in JN7 (pp. 247-262). because the information doesn't really depend much on the earlier chapters, and because
it is so useful.    The only things you need to know are:
* Skip over the section on p. 247 about "modules"; we won't need that yet (if at all in this course).
* You can skip from where it says "Doclets" on p. 259 to the end.

You should also have the starter code for the Polynomial lab {{page.polynomial_lab}}  handy when you work on this
assignment, since:
* it contains many examples of Javadoc comments
* some of the questions will refer to it.
