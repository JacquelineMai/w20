For the Final Exam:

* Concentrate on lab06, and lab07
* Also review your project work
   * There will be different questions for those that did the individual vs. the project track.

Some things to be sure you are familiar with:
* What is an `@Entity` in a Spring Boot application?
* What is a `@Repository` in a Spring Boot application?
* What is a `@Controller` in a Spring Boot application?
* What is JSON?
* What is the role of the `ObjectMapper` in converting between JSON and Java Beans?
* What is a Java Bean?
* What is the role of a controller method such as one that is annoted with:
   *  @GetMapping("/earthquakes/search")
   *  @GetMapping("/earthquakes/results")
   *  @PostMapping("/locations/add")


Those are topics that you've come across as you were coding.  But you may not have taken the time as you were coding to try to understand the bigger picture.    You have an opportunity now to step back and look at the bigger picture, and try to understand.  That's the "studying" you can do for the final exam.

I'm happy to answer questions today in class (in lecture), as well as over the Slack, and in office hours to try to help
clarify parts of this that you may be unclear about.
