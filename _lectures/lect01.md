# The course website

Here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io>

Note the two parts:
* Permanent part for CS56
* The part for /w20/ specifically

# Where is the syllabus?

It's here.  We're saving some trees.

# The special circumstances that led to two lectures

* I'm teaching an extra lecture section
* This is a voluntary service I'm doing for no extra compensation
* Why?
   * The altrusitic reason: I want to help students that were stranded due to poor resource planning
   * The selfish reason: a class larger than 72 doesn't work for this style of teaching

# My special passion: Teaching real world software practice

Why is this course different from all other courses?

Because as a young software developer I saw a gap between what I learned in school, and what i needed in industry.

A few observations:
* Note that it says nothing about Java, per se, but it's always been understood to be the department's "Java course".
* But, Java as a means to an end, not as the end goal

What is the goal?
* Applications Programming
* That includes a lot more than just Java

Here's a link list of some of the things it includes
* <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/applications_programming/>
* I made this list together with folks at AppFolio, a local software employer
* A lot of that stuff won't be in the textbooks!

# Where can you find info in this class?

* Textbooks
   * [HFJ](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/textbooks/HFJ) - Head First Java, 2nd editino
