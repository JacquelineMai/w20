# First Spring Boot App is Up

You can visit our first Spring Boot app here: 


| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Production | <https://ucsb-courses-search.herokuapp.com/> |
| Repo | <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-f19/ucsb-courses-search> |
| Travis-CI | <https://travis-ci.org/ucsb-cs56-f19/ucsb-courses-search> | 

# Take code from Spike and put it into production

We have a spike here that puts parameter values up on the results page:

* <https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-f19/ucsb-courses-search/tree/pcGetWorkingSearchButtonStandin>

# [`developer.ucsb.edu`](https://developer.ucsb.edu)

There are now APIs for lots of kinds of UCSB data.

We won't have to screen scrape anymore to get lots of this data.

We will, however, have to learn how to use APIs.
