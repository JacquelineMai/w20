# Midterm 2 is cancelled

The points for midterm 2 will be replaced with the higher of:
* your score on Midterm 1, or
* your score on the Final Exam.

That means that your final exam average will be either:
* ⅓ Midterm 1 + ⅔ Midterm 2, OR
* ⅔ Midterm 1 + ⅓ Midterm 2, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.

# Why are we cancelling Midterm 2

With:
* losing a lecture to Veterans Day
* losing a lecture to Thanksgiving
* being behind on getting the project started

We need all the lecture time we can get.
