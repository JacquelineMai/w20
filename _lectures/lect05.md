# You should be on Slack

It's important to be registered on the Slack.  One of the important skills we're learning in this course is professional communication, as it relates to software development.  The Slack channel will be our primary vehicle for that.

Important information will be disseminated there.   

There are clients for [iOS](https://slack.com/downloads/ios), [Android](https://slack.com/downloads/android), [Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac) and [Linux (.deb and .rpm)](https://slack.com/downloads/linux).

Or you can just use the web at <https://ucsb-cs56-f19.slack.com>

If you aren't on the Slack, get on the Slack!
