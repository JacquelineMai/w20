</li>



<li class="page-break-before" markdown="1"> Throughout this exam, there will be questions of the form:

Suppose you are at a job interview and the interviewer asks you about `_______`.   How do you respond?

In each case, your answer will be graded partially on correctness, and
partially on whether the answer would help you get the job.  Your
answer should be:

* Not too long, and rambling.  That annoys the interviewer and wastes time.
* Not too short.  It's too short if it leaves out so much detail that the the
   interviewer isn't sure whether you really understand the concept.

This time, the interviewer says this:

> QUESTION GOES HERE

<div style="clear:both;">
</div>

Give an answer that:
* (6 pts) PART ONE HERE
* (4 pts) PART TWO HERE

</li>


</ol>
